On December 28, 2011 I made the first commit to Password Pusher: an application to securely send passwords.  The core feature of the application is a single HTML form with a submit button.

Passwords are hosted at a secret URL and auto expire after a view count or duration.

 and shortly thereafter, I released the source as open source and hosted the application live at [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com/).  The application consisted entirely of exactly 1 HTML form with a submit button.

10 years later, Password Pusher is still alive and well.  It receives roughly 80k visitors/month and still features that 1 single HTML form with a submit button as it's core feature.

Here I will go over how this single popular open source project could be thought of as the smallest company in the world considering the massive amount of work that had to be put into it over the years.
