I build performance instrumentation for [Instana](https://www.instana.com/) that provides visibility into distributed application stacks.  Visibility consists of key metrics and distributed tracing of requests across processes and hosts.

As requests and data are processed in distributed applications, the instrumentation times and traces the execution path of the processing across process and host boundaries.

My current focus is on Python and Ruby performance instrumentation although I also do similar work in Go.


## Open Source

I contribute to a large number of open source projects.  See the [Projects](/projects) page or my [Github profile](https://github.com/pglombardo) for more details.
