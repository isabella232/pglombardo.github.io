We just opened the [Github repository](https://github.com/appneta/oboe-ruby) to the public and announced it [here](http://www.appneta.com/blog/open-sourcing-ruby/).

If any of you are using it or give it a run and have any issues/questions - feel free to ping me anytime at _pglombardo_ at _gmail.com_ or via a [support ticket](http://support.tv.appneta.com) through AppNeta.  I'd love to get as much feedback as possible.  They have a [free-forever project-level plan](http://www.appneta.com/products/traceview/) that always shows the last 24 hours of performance data.
