[PasswordPusher](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher) now has the ability to be deployed to Heroku with a single click using Heroku's new [deploy button](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/8/7/heroku-button).

Clicking on this button brings you to the Heroku app creation page.  The app is pre-configured and all you have to do is click confirm.  (Ok it takes two clicks...)
