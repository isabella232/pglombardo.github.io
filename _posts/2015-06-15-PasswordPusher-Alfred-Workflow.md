[Password Pusher](https://pwpush.com) now has an official [Alfred Workflow](http://www.packal.org/workflow/passwordpusher) available on [packal.org](http://www.packal.org/).

It will post a password to [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com) (via SSL; see workflow source if you like), copy the resulting URL to the clipboard and open it in the default browser.

Thanks to [psteinweber for the request/idea](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/issues/29).

Hope some of you find this useful!
